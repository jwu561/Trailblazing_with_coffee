## Description

The Barista App is an interactive web application designed to simulate the experience of ordering a drink from a barista. Users can select their drink preferences, including temperature, milk type, syrup flavor, and whether the drink should be blended. The app provides instant feedback on the user's selections and includes a feature to check if the constructed drink matches a predefined recipe.

## Features

- **Create Custom Drinks**: Select from a variety of options to create your custom drink.
- **Instant Feedback**: Get immediate visual cues to see if your selections match the secret recipe.
- **Validation Checks**: Receive alerts for invalid inputs or selections that don't match available options.

## How to Use

1. Select your drink preferences from the given options.
2. Click on "Check Answer" to see if your selections match the secret recipe.

5. Have fun testing your barista skills!
